## Workflow Decision Tree

**Creating a new project?**
→ Start with `assets/settings.gradle.kts.template` for settings and module includes  
→ Start with `assets/libs.versions.toml.template` for the version catalog  
→ Copy all files from `assets/convention/` to `build-logic/convention/src/main/kotlin/`  
→ Create `build-logic/settings.gradle.kts` (see `assets/convention/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`)  
→ Add `includeBuild("build-logic")` to root `settings.gradle.kts`  
→ Add plugin entries to `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (see `assets/convention/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`)
→ Copy `assets/proguard-rules.pro.template` to `app/proguard-rules.pro`
→ Read [modularization.md](references/modularization.md) for structure and module types  
→ Use [gradle-setup.md](references/gradle-setup.md) for build files and build logic  

**Configuring Gradle/build files?**
→ Use [gradle-setup.md](references/gradle-setup.md) for module `build.gradle.kts` patterns  
→ Use [gradle-setup.md](references/gradle-setup.md) → "Build Performance" for optimization workflow, diagnostics, and bottleneck troubleshooting  
→ Copy convention plugins from `assets/convention/` to `build-logic/` in your project  
→ See `assets/convention/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for setup instructions and examples  
→ Copy `assets/proguard-rules.pro.template` to `app/proguard-rules.pro` for R8 rules  

**Setting up code quality / Detekt?**
→ Use [code-quality.md](references/code-quality.md) for Detekt convention plugin setup  
→ Start from `assets/detekt.yml.template` for rules and enable Compose rules  

**Adding or updating dependencies?**
→ Follow [dependencies.md](references/dependencies.md)  
→ Update `assets/libs.versions.toml.template` if the dependency is missing  

**Adding a new feature/module?**
→ Follow module naming in [modularization.md](references/modularization.md)  
→ Implement Presentation in the feature module  
→ Follow dependency flow: Feature → Core/Domain → Core/Data

**Building UI screens/components?**
→ Read [compose-patterns.md](references/compose-patterns.md) for screen architecture, state, components, modifiers  
→ Use [compose-patterns.md](references/compose-patterns.md) -> State Management -> "Loading and refresh UX" for stable layout during loads and refreshes (avoid full-screen spinners that wipe context)  
→ Use [android-theming.md](references/android-theming.md) for Material 3 colors, typography, and shapes  
→ **Always** align Kotlin code with [kotlin-patterns.md](references/kotlin-patterns.md)  
→ Create Screen + ViewModel + UiState in the feature module  
→ Use shared components from `core/ui` when possible

**Handling State and Events?**
→ Use `StateFlow` for state; `Channel` + `receiveAsFlow()` for strict one-shot UI commands; `SharedFlow` for multicast or replay-intended events (see [coroutines-patterns.md](references/coroutines-patterns.md))
→ Survive process death with `SavedStateHandle` (see [compose-patterns.md](references/compose-patterns.md))

**Setting up app theme (colors, typography, shapes)?**
→ Follow [android-theming.md](references/android-theming.md) for Material 3 theming and dynamic colors  
→ Use semantic color roles from `MaterialTheme.colorScheme` (never hardcoded colors); pair every fill with its `on*` partner - see [Color Pairing Rules](references/android-theming.md#color-pairing-rules)  
→ Declare the **full** M3 color set in `Color.kt` (surface containers, dim/bright, `*Fixed`/`*FixedDim`) so dynamic color and contrast variants stay consistent - see [Full Color Role Reference](references/android-theming.md#full-color-role-reference-m3) and [Surface Container Hierarchy](references/android-theming.md#surface-container-hierarchy)  
→ Express depth via container tone first, shadows only for components that float over arbitrary content - see [Tonal Elevation vs Shadows](references/android-theming.md#tonal-elevation-vs-shadows)  
→ Use `outline` for interactive borders/focus, `outlineVariant` for decorative dividers - see [`outline` vs `outlineVariant`](references/android-theming.md#outline-vs-outlinevariant)  
→ Support light/dark themes with user preference toggle  
→ Enable dynamic color (Material You) for API 31+, harmonize brand/extended colors against `primary` - see [Brand Color Harmonization](references/android-theming.md#brand-color-harmonization)  
→ Honor the system contrast slider on Android 14+ (API 34) by shipping Medium/High-contrast scheme variants and reading `UiModeManager.getContrast()` - see [User Contrast Preference](references/android-theming.md#user-contrast-preference-android-14)  
→ For region-local palette overrides (destructive scopes, on-media toolbars), use a nested `MaterialTheme` with `colorScheme.copy(...)` - see [Scoped Themes](references/android-theming.md#scoped-themes)  
→ Pick `Card` / `OutlinedCard` / `ElevatedCard` by surface separation, not importance, and override shapes at the **token** level - see [Card Variants](references/compose-patterns.md#card-variants-filled--outlined--elevated) and [Component Shape Defaults](references/compose-patterns.md#component-shape-defaults)  

**Writing any Kotlin code?**
→ **Always** follow [kotlin-patterns.md](references/kotlin-patterns.md)  
→ Ensure practices align with [architecture.md](references/architecture.md), [modularization.md](references/modularization.md), and [compose-patterns.md](references/compose-patterns.md)

**Setting up data/domain layers?**
→ Read [architecture.md](references/architecture.md)  
→ Hilt `@Binds`, scopes, and DI anti-patterns: [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) -> Domain Layer -> "Dependency Injection Setup"  
→ Create Repository interfaces in `core/domain`  
→ Create implementations in `core/data` using Room 3/Retrofit/DataStore
→ Use DataStore for simple key-value pairs, Room 3 for complex relational data (`suspend` / `Flow` DAOs, `SQLiteDriver`)

**Implementing Lists and Scrolling?**
→ Use `LazyColumn`/`LazyRow` with stable keys and `contentType` (see [compose-patterns.md](references/compose-patterns.md))
→ For large datasets, use Paging 3 (see [compose-patterns.md](references/compose-patterns.md) -> "Paging 3")

**Handling Navigation?**
→ Use Navigation3 for adaptive navigation (see [android-navigation.md](references/android-navigation.md))
→ Avoid navigation anti-patterns (see [android-navigation.md](references/android-navigation.md) -> "Navigation Anti-Patterns")

**Optimizing Performance?**
→ Follow the Performance Checklist in [android-performance.md](references/android-performance.md)
→ If the user asks for **automated Play Console vitals** (CI/Slack, no Play Console UI), use [android-performance.md](references/android-performance.md) → **Optional: Play Vitals observability (Play Developer Reporting API)**
→ Use `BasicTextField2` for high-frequency text input

**Testing?**
→ Read [testing.md](references/testing.md) for testing philosophy and patterns
→ Use Turbine for testing Flow emissions (see [testing.md](references/testing.md) -> "Testing Flow Emissions with Turbine")
→ Create Repository interfaces in `core/domain`
→ Implement Repository in `core/data`
→ Create DataSource + DAO in `core/data`

**Implementing offline-first or data synchronization?**
→ Follow [android-data-sync.md](references/android-data-sync.md) for sync strategies, conflict resolution, and cache invalidation  
→ Use Room 3 as single source of truth with sync metadata (syncStatus, lastModified)  
→ Schedule background sync with WorkManager  
→ Monitor network state before syncing  

**Setting up navigation?**
→ Follow [android-navigation.md](references/android-navigation.md) for Navigation3 architecture, state management, and adaptive navigation  
→ See [modularization.md](references/modularization.md) for feature module navigation components (Destination, Navigator, Graph)  
→ Configure navigation graph in the app module  
→ Use feature navigation destinations and navigator interfaces  

**Adding tests?**
→ Use [testing.md](references/testing.md) for patterns and examples  
→ Use [testing.md](references/testing.md) → "Screenshot Testing" for Compose Preview Screenshot Testing setup  
→ Keep test doubles in `core/testing`  

**Handling runtime permissions?**
→ Follow [android-permissions.md](references/android-permissions.md) for manifest declarations and Compose permission patterns  
→ Request permissions contextually and handle "Don't ask again" flows  

**Showing notifications or foreground services?**
→ Use [android-notifications.md](references/android-notifications.md) for notification channels, styles, actions, and foreground services  
→ Check POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission on API 33+ before showing notifications  
→ Create notification channels at app startup (required for API 26+)  

**Sharing logic across ViewModels or avoiding base classes?**
→ Use delegation via interfaces as described in [kotlin-delegation.md](references/kotlin-delegation.md)  
→ Prefer small, injected delegates for validation, analytics, or feature flags  

**Adding crash reporting / monitoring?**
→ Follow [crashlytics.md](references/crashlytics.md) for provider-agnostic interfaces and module placement  
→ Use DI bindings to swap between Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry  

**Enabling StrictMode guardrails?**
→ Follow [android-strictmode.md](references/android-strictmode.md) for app-level setup and Compose compiler diagnostics  
→ Use Sentry/Firebase init from [crashlytics.md](references/crashlytics.md) to ship StrictMode logs  

**Choosing design patterns for a new feature, business logic, or system?**
→ Use [design-patterns.md](references/design-patterns.md) for Android-focused pattern guidance  
→ Align with [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) and [modularization.md](references/modularization.md)  

**Measuring performance regressions or startup/jank?**
→ Use [android-performance.md](references/android-performance.md) for Macrobenchmark, Baseline Profiles, and ProfileInstaller setup  
→ Keep benchmark module aligned with `benchmark` build type in [gradle-setup.md](references/gradle-setup.md)  
→ If the user explicitly requests to investigate jank or add custom trace points, use [android-performance.md](references/android-performance.md) for System Tracing (`androidx.tracing`) setup

**Setting up app initialization or splash screen?**
→ Follow [android-performance.md](references/android-performance.md) → "App Startup & Initialization" for App Startup library, lazy init, and splash screen  
→ Avoid ContentProvider-based auto-initialization - use `Initializer` interface instead  
→ Use `installSplashScreen()` with `setKeepOnScreenCondition` for loading state  

**Adding icons, images, or custom graphics?**
→ Use [android-graphics.md](references/android-graphics.md) for Material Symbols icons and custom drawing  
→ Download icons via Iconify API or Google Fonts (avoid deprecated `Icons.Default.*` library)  
→ Use `Modifier.drawWithContent`, `drawBehind`, or `drawWithCache` for custom graphics  

**Creating custom UI effects (glow, shadows, gradients)?**
→ Check [android-graphics.md](references/android-graphics.md) for Canvas drawing, BlendMode, and Palette API patterns  
→ Use `rememberInfiniteTransition` for animated effects  

**Ensuring accessibility compliance (TalkBack, touch targets, color contrast)?**
→ Follow [android-accessibility.md](references/android-accessibility.md) for semantic properties and WCAG guidelines  
→ Provide `contentDescription` for all icons and images  
→ Ensure 48dp × 48dp minimum touch targets  
→ Test with TalkBack and Accessibility Scanner  

**Working with images and color extraction?**
→ Use [android-graphics.md](references/android-graphics.md) → "Image Loading with Coil3" for AsyncImage, SubcomposeAsyncImage, rememberAsyncImagePainter, and Hilt ImageLoader setup  
→ Use [android-graphics.md](references/android-graphics.md) for Palette API and color extraction  

**Implementing complex coroutine flows or background work?**
→ Follow [coroutines-patterns.md](references/coroutines-patterns.md) for structured concurrency patterns  
→ Use appropriate dispatchers (IO, Default, Main) and proper cancellation handling  
→ Prefer `StateFlow` (and `SharedFlow` where appropriate) over `Channel` for observable **state**; use `Channel` for one-shot commands as in [coroutines-patterns.md](references/coroutines-patterns.md)  
→ Use `callbackFlow` to wrap Android callback APIs (connectivity, sensors, location) into Flow  
→ Use `suspendCancellableCoroutine` for one-shot callbacks (Play Services tasks, biometrics)  
→ Use `combine()` to merge multiple Flows in ViewModels, `shareIn` to share expensive upstream  
→ Handle backpressure with `buffer`, `conflate`, `debounce`, or `sample`  

**Need to share behavior across multiple classes?**
→ Use [kotlin-delegation.md](references/kotlin-delegation.md) for interface delegation patterns  
→ Avoid base classes; prefer composition with delegated interfaces  
→ Examples: Analytics, FormValidator, CrashReporter  

**Refactoring existing code or improving architecture?**
→ Review [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) for layer responsibilities  
→ Read [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) -> "Cross-cutting anti-patterns (quick reference)" for common layering mistakes  
→ Check [design-patterns.md](references/design-patterns.md) for applicable patterns
